        <h2>"Stay Home Stay Safe"</h2>
        <p>COVID-19 disease is spreading around the world at a fast pace. Extensive research is being conducted by
            various countries to contain this spread. In this situation, every one of us should take all the measures
            possible to avoid an infection.</p>
        <div>
            <section class="box">
                <h2>Maintain Hygiene</h2>
                <p>The very first thing which the experts are emphasizing upon is that Coronavirus can be killed with
                    soap
                    and water. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds as frequently as required. For example before
                    meals,
                    after visiting the washroom, after touching any surface that you feel might be contaminated, etc.

                <h2>Practice Social Distancing</h2>
                <p>It is advised that a distance of at least 3 to 6 feet should be maintained between yourself and other
                    people. This should be thoroughly practised in case you are required to step out of the house.
                    Remember
                    to avoid getting in the close proximity of a stranger.</p>

            <section class="box">
                <h2>Avoid Going Out</h2>
                <p>One cannot know who is infected from the Coronavirus, thus it is best to stay at home and avoid the
                    transmission. It is found that one person infected by COVID-19 can transmit it to multiple others.
                    Imagine this as an uncontrolled chain reaction. Only you can break the chain by staying at home.</p>
